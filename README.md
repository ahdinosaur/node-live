# WIP node-live

restart node when required files are modified

**just an experiment**

for something that works, use [`fgnass/node-dev`](https://github.com/fgnass/node-dev).

## example

`git clone` this repo and go into directory

run `node example`

see the output

```
entry: hello this is entry.
other: something else is here.
```

change `example/other.js`

```
entry: hello this is entry.
other: i'm alone here.
```
